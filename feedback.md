# Project 3 Feedback

## Project Strengths

* Homepage video looks awesome and really conveys the theme of the app!
* Nice job with the seeded database of anime -- it's a step in the direction of creating your own anime API.
* Good use of custom routes for your anime search and results.
* Users and sessions functionality thoroughly implemented.
* Great job with jQuery validate in the forms!

## Areas of Improvement

* See code comments marked with `CJ`
* You have full CRUD functionality set up in your `users_controller`. Work on building out this functionality on your site by adding the corresponding views.
* Stretch yourself to build a "favoriting" functionality so users can save anime they are interested in. You'll need a many-to-many relationship with a JOIN table.
* Fill out your `README` to include a little about the project, what technologies you used, and the steps to run the project locally.
* Next time you're working on a project focus on way more frequent and descriptive commit messages. You should have at least 20-30 for a project like this, and make sure they describe exactly what was changed (i.e. functionality added, bugs fixed). It's extremely important when working with other developers to record the project's history in an organized and descriptive way.
